# Helo-Moon
android application 3 from the book "The Big Nerd Ranch guide"

provided key points:
-hosting fragment using layout fragment (this ease costs losing flexibility and power working with the FragmentMenager but it can be reasonable choise with
   simple app with a static part)
- working with MediaPlayer class, methods: .release(); .start();
- pausing challange
- setRetainInstance(true);
 for handling rotation issues. Using retained fragment  will be not destroyed and recreated on rotation.
- localization (process of providing appropriate resources based on the device's language settings)
